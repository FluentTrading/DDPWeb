Rebooting:
====================================================
Tuesday Night:
	1) Update Week Number after the game.
	2) Reboot so the winnings can be calculated.

Wednesday Night:
	1) So picks can be reloaded
	

NOTE:
http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/scores/scores.json points to next week on Wed.


Enhancements:
====================================================
( Added a method to check this)
1) Show a background animation when teams have been picked BUT none of the games have started.

2) Team record should be available in analytics
3) Put Al bundy in the background on the winning Page:


6) With the data We now have access to a lot more info, see what can be used.
Can we show these during the game or will it take too much screen space?
Home -> Stats
Away -> Stats
CBS Game Center has for each team:
Pass
Rush
Rec


Picks:
===================================================
1)	In DBService, we load the teamMap when the context starts.
	Therefore, if the website is running & we pick teams.
	It won't get automatically reflected.
	When we save the picks, we should also update the teamMap.

Schedule:
===================================================
1)	Show AM/PM in time
3)  Group schedule by date (like CBS sports schedule)
