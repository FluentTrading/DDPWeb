We are now using the full feed to power this app!
=================================================
1. For live score, we cannot only parse the game that are going on as we show info on all three games.
What we can do, it parse the games that are in future but only get the basics (mostly from Schedule)
           
    //TODO: improve by checking time not just date           
           
           
2. Cache the data for games that has finished for the week.
3. Cash Manager is throwing an error, commented out for now.
4. We now have access to a lot more info, see what can be used.


Rebooting:
====================================================
Monday Night:
	1) Update Week Number after the game.
	2) Reboot so the winnings can be calculated.

Wednesday Night:
	1) So picks can be reloaded
	

Enhancements:
====================================================
UI:
1) Update Seahawks, Ramns, Colts logos?

1. Chakka flag for the looser
2. Team record should be available in analytics
3. If multiple users are logged on to the servlet, how does the servlet know to display the game that the user click on?
   Does it show the last game that was clicked on?


Week Number:
1) Currently, we put the week number in the web.xml.
   The link for current week isn't working anymore.
   Don't try to read from DB with picks, as we could have bye week.

Picks:
1)	In DBService, we load the teamMap when the context starts.
	Therefore, if the website is running & we pick teams.
	It won't get automatically reflected.
	When we save the picks, we should also update the teamMap.


Prod Check
===============================
Make analytics uncliackable if we dont finish.
Remove all TODOs
Check game start date, week number and links to get scores.


Schedule:
1)	Show AM/PM in time
2)	Show Stadium Location if possible
3)  Group schedule by date (like CBS sports schedule) 
4)  We have all the schedules downloaded with stadium info, should we store them in DB?
