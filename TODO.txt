Prod Check
===============================
Make analytics uncliackable if we dont finish.

Can we use full screen for the app?
Review all the colors
Remove all TODOs
Check game start date, week number and links to get scores.
Check in source code to github

Rebooting:
====================================================
Monday Night:
	1) Update Week Number after the game.
	2) Reboot so the winnings can be calculated.

Wednesday Night:
	1) So picks can be reloaded
	

Enhancements:
====================================================
1. Chakka flag for the looser
2. Team record should be available in analytics
3. If multiple users are logged on to the servlet, how does the servlet know to display the game that the user click on?
   Does it show the last game that was clicked on?


Week Number:
1) Currently, we put the week number in the web.xml.
   The link for current week isn't working anymore.
   Don't try to read from DB with picks, as we could have bye week.

Picks:
1)	In DBService, we load the teamMap when the context starts.
	Therefore, if the website is running & we pick teams.
	It won't get automatically reflected.
	When we save the picks, we should also update the teamMap.

Schedule:
1)	Show AM/PM in time
2)	Show Stadium Location if possible
3)  Group schedule by date (like CBS sports schedule) 
4)  ALign the game Time properly


UI:
1) Update Seahawks, Ramns, Colts logos?
